# Momentum Clone Project

## Goal of the Project

The primary goal of this TypeScript-React project is to emulate the functionality of the Momentum extension for Chrome, providing a personalized dashboard that greets the user, shows the current time, weather status, date, and a daily quote. It is designed to enhance productivity and offer convenience right in the browser.

## Deployment

The project is currently live and can be viewed at [www.myproject.com](https://www.myproject.com).

## Description

This Momentum clone is an interactive dashboard that greets users with a personal message at the center of the screen along with the current time. It provides a seamless and minimalistic user experience, displaying the weather status and date in the top corners, and a motivational quote with its author at the bottom of the screen.

## Outcome

The project serves as a testament to the implementation of modern React practices, such as the use of hooks for state management and effects, and props for component communication.

## Stack

The technology stack includes:

- **TypeScript**: for type-safe code
- **React**: for building the user interface with hooks and component-based architecture.
- **SASS**

## Vision

The vision for this project is to expand its capabilities by adding two more features:

1. **Links**: Allowing users to add, organize, and access their most frequented or favorite URLs.
2. **To-do Box**: Enabling users to manage their tasks with add/remove functionalities.

## Stage of the Project

The project is currently in progress, with the main functionalities of the Momentum clone implemented. The next phase involves the development of the "Links" and "To-do" features, which are currently in the planning and design stages.
